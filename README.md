Welcome to the GitHub Repository page for CGSC 5101 / HCIN 5400 lecture notes
available at [chunyunma.me](https://chunyunma.me/). 


## Contents of this Repository

These lecture notes are liberally inspired by [ModernDive.com](https://moderndive.com/), 
hence the title "Baby Modern Dive". 
For many chapters, the lecture notes are almost identical to the original book. 
Why creating this copy instead of just giving you the link to the original book? 
You ask. 

Two reasons. 
First one is for the readers' benefit. 
I used Modern Dive for the first time 
when I was teaching this course in 2020 winter. 
At the time, the original book, although available online, 
was still in its draft mode. 
I was not completely satisfied with some aspects of it, 
so I made my own edits while developing the course material. 
Instead of dropping links everywhere in the lecture notes, 
I decided to integrate the original book (for the most part) 
with my edits (a very small portion). 

Second reason is more personal. 
Recreating the book, with some tinkering, 
has been a great learning experience for me. 
I won't lie; it is a lot of fun. 

In case you are curious, 
ModernDive as well as these lecture notes 
are built using [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package; 
for more information on how to use `bookdown` 
see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/). 
If you'd like to build the book on your own, 
please make sure to first install the `bookdown` package 
via `install.packages("bookdown")`.

* The `bookdown` source code for the current version of the lecture notes 
is in the `master` branch of this repo. 

* The contents of [chunyunma.me](https://chunyunma.me/) 
are deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 
from the `master` branch of this repo.
