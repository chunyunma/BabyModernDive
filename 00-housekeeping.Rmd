## What's with the name? {-}

The material is largely based on a book called "Modern Dive". 
<!-- may expand the list of inspirations -->
I first stumbled upon the book 
when I was preparing for teaching this course in 2019. 
I personally benefited greatly from reading the book, 
and teaching a course using its material.

#### What do I hope to deliver, content-wise {-}

<!-- stats vs. data science 
see "What we hope you will learn from this hope in Preface"
A modified version:
Experience the life cycle of a data analysis pipeline 
from raw data to meaninful narration, ready for readers 
of various background. This entails: 
- data wrangling (maybe a different term is better)
- Apply appropriate model to the data
- "decode" output filled with technical jargons, interpret results, make inferences
- Learn how to use R to turn the process reproducible
There are more minor objectives, but these should give a high-level overview

Elaborate on reproducible research
