  abstract = {Investigated predictions of the network-interference theory in the retrieval of multiplication facts in 2 experiments involving 27 undergraduates (aged 19\textendash 30 yrs). Ss were tested with 36 interference or practice multiplication problems. Results indicate that retrieval of a product via one problem increased the probability that this product will be retrieved in error to another problem later. The effect of retrieval priming on error patterns was problem-specific, occurring when there were relatively strong associations between a problem and the false answers that were primed. Correct retrieval times for specific problems were increased or decreased by manipulating the activation levels of strong false associates through correct retrievals via other problems. It is argued that single-digit multiplication problems access a network structure of candidate answers and that different problems can overlap in the network substructures they activate. A model of network interference is proposed in which activation is distributed among candidate answers as a multiplicative function of associative and node strengths. Predictions derived from the hypothesis that adults' production of simple number combinations is governed substantially by procedural operations were not confirmed. (40 ref)},

  abstract = {A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the ``scatterplot'') and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ``poems.'' Supplemental materials are available online.},
